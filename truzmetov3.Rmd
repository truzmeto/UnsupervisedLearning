```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### K-means Clustering

Randomly initilize K centroids in a given space (2D, 3D, ..), where N-features defines dimention. Then for each data point calculate distance to
all centroids and choose the closest centroid to assign a label. After assignment is complete, move each centroid to the center of mass location of
corresponding class(label). Reitarate until locations of centroids converge to some position.  


### Expectation Maximization Algorithm



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
