# Unsupervised Learning Project

## Introduction

Here we apply and explore the role of two unsupervised learning algorithms such as
K-means Clustering and Expectation Maximization on two distinct data sets. Adittionally, we
investigate how dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, ICA, RP, FA help speeding up
performance by reducing the dimension of feature space.

### Required:

**R** is only used for data preprocessing cleanig etc.
**Python3.5**

**To genarate results type the following in cmd:**

mkdir -p output clean_data plots

Rscript LC_cleaning.R

Rscript AD_cleaning.R

python AD.py

python LC.py
